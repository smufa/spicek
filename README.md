## Speech Check

Giving a speech in front of a crowd of people is nerve-wracking for most people. It triggers stress, anxiety, and that sinking feeling in your stomach. And that’s totally normal. No one’s born with a magical "presentation gene". Even the most confident speakers you’ve seen, those who seem to glide through their talks with ease, have gotten there through lots of practice.
But even with practice, it’s hard to know how you’re really doing. Asking friends or family for feedback often feels awkward, and let’s face it - they lose interest pretty fast.
That’s where our tool comes in. We’ve built a web app that helps you sharpen your presentation skills with the help of AI. You can rehearse as many times as you like, and our system will give you instant feedback - not just on your words, but also your body language. It analyzes things like speech rate, filler words, volume, pitch, posture, and gestures. The goal? To help you get better, feel more confident, and actually enjoy the process along the way.
